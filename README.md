## Plans

In future releases, I plan to enhance NihongoLens with the following features:

1. **Google Translations:** Integrate Google Translate API to provide accurate translations for scanned text.

2. **Google Vision API:** Utilize the Google Vision API for improved OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities.

3. **ChatGPT Breakdowns:** Implement ChatGPT to provide breakdowns and explanations of scanned sentences, aiding in language learning and comprehension.

Stay tuned for updates!
